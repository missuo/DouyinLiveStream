# DouyinLiveStream
This is a Web API written in Flask that converts Douyin live room share links into M3U8 live stream links.

## Why is it Flask or Python?
Because some steps require the use of SeleniumBase and PyExecJS, Python may be the best choice.

## How to use it?
You can directly watch live broadcasts without watermarks and subtitles in players like IINA, or of course, you can use FFmpeg for recording.

## Compatible projects
I am currently developing a live stream downloader written in Go, which supports subscribing to some live rooms. It will automatically start recording as soon as the live broadcast begins.
